There is no big appetite for Boris on our benches.\\n\\'He hasn\\'t done much with the role of Foreign Secretary. He is still acting like a journalist rather than a senior diplomat.\\'\\nIn July Mr Johnson was forced to deny rumours sweeping Westminster that he was on the verge of quitting.\\nOne Tory source said this week that he was ‘so low’ he had been put on ‘resignation watch’ by No 10.\\nThe resignation of Mr Johnson would destabilise Mrs May’s fragile government and set off a chain of events that could force her from office.\\nOne friend insisted he was not considering quitting, but hinted at tensions with No 10.\\n‘I think he is clear that if he’s pushed he will push back on policy and on (cabinet) jobs. But it is all about staying in government, not walking away,’ the friend said.\\nMr Johnson uses his article to set out an upbeat vision for a ‘glorious’ post-Brexit future as a low-tax, low regulation economy freed from the shackles of Brussels.\\nHe insists that Britain can be ‘the greatest country on earth’ and rounds on so-called Remoaners ‘who think we are going to bottle it’.\\nHe also accuses Labour of ‘chickening out’ of Brexit after voting against the EU Withdrawal Bill and backing single market membership in the short term.\\nOn his controversial £350 million a week claim, he writes: ‘Once we have settled our accounts, we will take back control of roughly £350m per week.\\n“It would be a fine thing, as many of us have pointed out, if a lot of that money went on the NHS, provided we use that cash injection to modernise and make the most of new technology.”\\nHe says that opponents, including the ‘the government, the BBC, Barack Obama, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the CBI’ tried to prevent Brexit and are now ‘woefully underestimating this country’.\\nMr Johnson calls for Britain to ‘keep environmental and social protections that are fair and wise’, but saysEU red tape costing anything between 4 and 7 per cent of GDP should be ditched.\\nMr Johnson, who has clashed repeatedly with the Chancellor, says Brexit should be used as an opportunity ‘reform our tax system’.\\n‘Outside the EU there are obvious opportunities… in the setting of indirect taxation,’ he writes. ‘At the stroke of a pen, the Chancellor will be able to cut VAT on tampons; often demanded by parliament but – absurdly – legally impossible to deliver.’\\nDowning Street last night attempted to play down the row.\\nA source said: ‘Boris’s views on Brexit are well known. As you’ll see in the PM’s speech next week, the Governmenbt is united in our determination to make the most of the opportiunities for a successful future.\\xa0', image_url='http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/15/23/445410E600000578-0-image-a-6_1505514465535.jpg', article_url='http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4889654/Boris-throws-gauntlet-Brexit.html')\n"
